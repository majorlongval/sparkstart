# projinit 🚀
**Start your new Python project in seconds, not minutes.**

You have an idea? `projinit` handles the boring setup so you can start coding immediately.

### What it does
1. 📂 Creates your project folder and structure.
2. 🐍 Sets up a Python virtual environment.
3. ☁️ **Automatically creates a GitHub repository** and pushes your code.

### 1. Prerequisites (Do you have these?)
*   **Python** (3.8+) → [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
*   **Git** → [Download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### 2. Install
Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and run:
```bash
pip install projinit
```

### 3. Create your Project
Run this command, replacing `my-awesome-game` with your project name:

```bash
projinit new my-awesome-game --github
```

**What happens next?**
1.  `projinit` will ask for a **GitHub Token**.
2.  It will **automatically open your browser** to the right GitHub page.
3.  Just scroll down, click **"Generate token"**, and paste it into the terminal.
4.  Done! Your project is live on GitHub and ready to code.
